Group assignment with my coursemate, Tan Jia Yi.

Provided are Java File, Form File and Text File for this project. There is no folder directory provided. Form File are generated by Netbeans, not coded.

### üìå Assumptions to made:
1. All payment transactions are paid to SPOODMS through debit or credit card or online banking method.
2. Admins and delivery staffs are well-trained to utilize SPOODMS.
3. Customers are not dyslexic and not suffering from color vision deficiency (CVD) because sometimes SPOODMS will have disabled buttons or error messages.
4. Delivery staffs are paid monthly based on the numbers of order delivery they accepted and delivered successfully.
5. The profit of SPOODMS is taken from the total sales of all orders.
6. Item added to cart by customer, if has been changed or updated by admin, will be considered as last item in stock, price of the item in cart will not be changed.
